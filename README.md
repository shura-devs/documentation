## The Aim:

Embark on a number of tutorials and projects as a team to improve our software engineering skills.

Benefits:
- Motivate each other to learn and grow
- Gain valuable experience by doing real world projects
- Hands on help/guidance/mentorship from more experienced Software Engineers

## The Plan:

1. Online courses to learn programming language syntax.
2. Basic Object Orientated Programming Project per language (6-8 hours work)
3. Online courses + one-to-one help to learn **Git**, **Github**, **Testing** and **Continous Integration**.
4. Learn web applications concepts (client, server, HTTP, REST APIs).
5. 2 part large project (front and back end) which we will all work together to achieve.

Course links, tutorials, programming article links will be provided for all of the above in various repositories in this organisation.

## First Steps

1. Create a Github Account: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
2. Send Aaquib a message to add you to this organisation.

## Teams

### Front-End (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React)
1. Installation and Setup: TODO
2. Online Courses: TODO

### Back-End (Python, Flask, MongoDB)
1. Installation and Setup: TODO
2. Online Courses: TODO 

### Advanced - Docker

For those of you who are advanced, we can start to look at setting up your environment with Docker. This dramatically improves local development giving a wide range of benefits including:

- Declarative dependencies
- Ephemereal environments
- Much less pain installing stuff

If there is demand, we will include some documentation on this. Please discuss this on Slack.
